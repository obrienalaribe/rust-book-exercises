// We allow dead code and unused variables and macros throughout the exam because they appear in
// many places in the starter code. You should remove this when you think you are done so that the
// CI can help you find potential mistakes.
#![allow(dead_code)]
#![allow(unused_variables)]
#![allow(unused_macros)]

// Note that your exam will be graded with some unit tests that will be executed as a integration tests (https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/testing/integration_testing.html). This has some important implications:
//
// 1. Do not make anything private.
// 2. Do not change the name/signature of any function.
// 3. be aware that your macros are going to be executed in different file!
//
// The tests in each module `module_name` will import:
// `use pba_entrance_exam::*;`
// `use pba_entrance_exam::module_name::*;`
